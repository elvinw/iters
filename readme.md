Part of AMP Agency interview coding challenge.

## Completed Components
- AJAX form validation checks for all fields
- email validation checks for proper ```name@domain.net``` format
- Pirate speak message transcriber: works for both placeholder and user submissions (when one selects "Arr!")
- Fade-in thank you landing page triggered by form submission
- Fixed database connectivity and query issues
- When "Arr!" is no longer selected, the form reverts the translated message/placeholder back into regular English
- /piters, a uniquely pirate IT experience
